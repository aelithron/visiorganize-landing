# visiorganize-landing
This is just meant to be a landing page. If you want to look at the actual app or deploy it yourself, check out [the Visiorganize repo](https://github.com/aelithron/visiorganize).
## What this website does
This mostly exists to show the app's features and explain what it does. It's a relatively small app, I just hated how abruptly the app loaded for my hosted version and needed an excuse for extra hours lol
